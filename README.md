# Corrupt
# Character Interactions

This branch is only for headers and cpps that interact with the characters.h
file. They can also interact with the enemy classes, Keyholder and Guard. All
prerequisites for the guards except for the behaviour is complete. Behaviour 
is how the guards move and that is a product of the Movement branch.
